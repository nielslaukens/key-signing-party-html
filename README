HTML keylist generator
----------------------

This is a simple Perl script that renders a GnuPG keyring in to a keylist file
in HTML. It attempts to reduce the number of UIDs by collapsing "identical"
UIDs into 1 line. Currently, "identical" means the same UID after removing the
email address and the comment.

It looks for a file `keyring.gpg` in the current directory, or the file
specified on the command line. It outputs the HTML to stdout, so be sure to
redirect this!
